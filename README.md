# Connect an Accelerometer to the Internet of Things

* 3-axis sensing
* Small, low profile package
* 4 mm × 4 mm × 1.45 mm LFCSP
* Low power : 350 μA (typical)
* Single-supply operation: 1.8 V to 3.6 V
* 10,000 g shock survival
* Excellent temperature stability
* BW adjustment with a single capacitor per axis
* RoHS/WEEE lead-free compliant

> The sensor is a polysilicon surface-micromachined structure built on top of a silicon wafer. Polysilicon springs suspend the structure over the surface of the wafer and provide a resistance against forces due to applied acceleration.
As described in [the data sheet](http://www.sainsmart.com/arduino-adxl335-triple-axis-accelerometer-breakout-module.html).

> By measuring the amount of static acceleration due to gravity, you can find out the angle the device is tilted at with respect to the earth. By sensing the amount of dynamic acceleration, you can analyze the way the device is moving. At first, measuring tilt and acceleration doesn't seem all that exciting. However, engineers have come up with many ways to make really useful products with them.
